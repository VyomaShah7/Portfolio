								    <h3>SRM Games</h3>
								    <p><span class="image right"><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1c1uUPJIAF_d1mQ8sgsMskRrGWq1CwZM5/view?usp=sharing" class="image fit"><img src="images/SRMGames.PNG" alt="SRM Games" /></a></span>
										SRMGames is a prototype of Game that I have created with the idea of compiling all types of simple games as a subgame to a single game.</p>
								    <hr />
								    <p>Here, players can find different genres of game at the same destination and play whichever game they want to play. I have also made sure to make the game simpler so that a wide range of audience can enjoy playing it and enjoy playing video games. For now, three genres are implemented which are shooting game, riddle game and destructor game.</p>

									<h3>Castler Game</h3>
									<p><span class="image left"><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bUNFyVhlf3qksc5MkuYDIszP6Z869lr7/view?usp=sharing" class="image fit"><img src="images/CastlerGameCreationShot.PNG" alt="Castler Game" /></a></span>
										Castler is a castle demolition game based on the demolition prototype referenced from the book. In this game the main objective is to demolish the castles and cross the levels to get to a new level. The levels here are not connected to each other so a player can play the levels in any order the player wants to play. Also, the shots taken to pass each level are noted on the screen and each level has two sections to pass the level.</p>
									<hr />
									<p>The game starts with a start screen then moves forward to a levels pane from which a level can be selected and after the level is passed the level completed screen is shown. To demolish the castles a slingshot mechanism is given which is made up of a catapult and a sphere. Here, the sphere is shot from the catapult and the sphere is hit on the castle to a point marked as goal and if the goal is hit then the castle breaks and gets demolished.</p>

									<h3>Cherry Scooper Game</h3>
								    <p><span class="image right"><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UxJRMJgknkE1L_9lc3KnW0uBhIDGN8HX/view?usp=sharing" class="image fit"><img src="images/CherryScooperGame.PNG" alt="Cherry Scooper Game" /></a></span>
										CherryScooper is an ApplePicker prototype game. The game's main objective is to collect all the cherries falling from the given tree in the main scene in a basket and the cherry is destroyed or in a sense collected in the basket and this scores points. Through these score points we can also make sure to understand whether the game is able to make new scores and store it or not.</p>
								    <hr />
								    <p> There are a lot of components involved here like a cherry tree, cherries, baskets, highscore counter, a score counter and all the physics and mechanics that help in making the tree move and cherries drop and get collected. The tree is moving in the game as well as the baskets which is making the game have a bit of higher difficulty than the tree just being static there. The mechanics and real game dynamics are explained in further sections.</p>

									<h3>Whizzle Maze Runner</h3>
								    <p><span class="image left"><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SFpLfr8K3hj3VB924iQqB4nHHiaVTPOD/view?usp=share_link" class="image fit"><img src="images/CherryScooperGame.PNG" alt="Cherry Scooper Game" /></a></span>
										Maze games or we can say find the path games are games in which a player requires a lot of focus to successfully find the path and to reach a destination with given constraints.</p>
								    <hr />
								    <p> The game has a maze creted whose difficulty increases with level increase and there is a ball with gravity enabled to solve the mazerunner by finding the correct path. The correct path finding uses the path finding algorithm with backtracking to solve the maze crossing puzzle.</p>
