										To understand why people play mobile games for long hours and how to give them personalized recommendations to start something new and simple rather than playing mobile games.</p>

									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/GamestoSurvey2.PNG" alt="" /></span>Survey Taken: To generate a form which gets responses from people about whether they play games or not, how many hours they play games, what are their hobbies, what type of games they play and the reason they play games.

									<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/GamestoSurvey3.PNG" alt="" /></span>In this procedure I have primarily used bar charts to understand the pattern of different features involved in the dataset and google form has produced bar charts based on data for the same purpose. I have also used python through jupyter notebook and its libraries(like pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib) to get two different methods implemented first to get recommended activities and then to get personalized suggestions with descriptions.
										For recommending similar activities I have used TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity to identify similar interests between different players. Through this code I got the answer as activities that matched the most with other players being suggested as top recommendations and based on that suggestion it also provides a description for how to approach the suggested skill in a simple and concise way. The code also provides the information on personalized recommendations for all the responders if needed.

									<p>In this paper, the results of a comprehensive comparative analysis of nine different classification algorithms are presented and their performance evaluated. The results indicate that none of the classifiers outperformed all others in terms of accuracy, meaning that multiple classifiers can serve clinicians in diagnostic procedure.</p>

										<h2><a href="#">Image Captioning under Visual storytelling<br />
										</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="images/Caption Length.PNG" class="image fit"><img src="images/Caption Length.PNG" alt="" /></a>
									<p>The paper is following a visual storytelling concept of image captioning which will produce captions or descriptions of images for the people that use accessibility measures in their daily lives. So that they can also enjoy what is being displayed. The algorithm is using neural networks and other techniques to produce an output of image captioning through supervised learning. The images are the input which are preprocessed and trained to produce captions for any images in the testing section after being trained with a large amount of images. There are other applications for image captioning such as using it as transcription during remote seminars, meetings, lectures and so on. This makes it easier to understand what is being displayed even if it is not clearly visible. The algorithms and their advantages and limitations along with the proposed algorithm is discussed further in the paper.</p>
